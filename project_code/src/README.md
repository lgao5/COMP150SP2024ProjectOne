Quick description:
The towns explorer game is essentially a simplified version of D&D, where you choose the character count
and each character starts with a certain amount of each statistic and capacity (of Mana, Stamina, Psy), then you are prompted 5 options for each character, one option can be executed per round;

explore: This is where you navigate the game quests, and if you have the required amount of the specific capacity AND               statistic for the adventure you are on, you will pass the quest and lose that amount of the statistic. A passed             quest may not be revisited. Passing a quest increases your experience points, and after a certain amount you         level up

Rest: This is where your character chooses to rest to regain power and gain a random of 1-3 of each statistic, the idea is       if you failed a previous quest, you may regain strength through resting to be able to beat it later. After resting,       you may revisit previously failed quests.

Quit: Your character decides to leave the game, they will be removed and game proceeds with whoever is left, if no one,           game ends

Save: this is where you can choose to save the game of each character in a .csv file at anytime. 


buy capacity: This option allows you to use 5 constitution to buy 2 capacity points, in the case that you do not have enough [Mana or Psy or Stamina] capacity to proceed with an adventure, this is the only way to gain capacity since it is rare in itself

HOW to play game:
Respond to the prompts as directed in the game, if there is a typo the game will terminate (would take a long time to incorporate raising errors just to keep the game running, so beware not to make any typos). 
Choose the number of characters
Name each character
decide one of 5 options by typing them for each character 'explore' 'rest' 'quit' 'save' 'buy capacity'
then read what happens and make a decision for next time it is your round
repeat...
