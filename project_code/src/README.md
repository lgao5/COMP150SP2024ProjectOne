Quick description:
The towns explorer game is essentially a simplified version of D&D, where you choose the character count
and each character starts with a certain amount of each statistic, then you are prompted 4 options;
explore: This is where you navigate the game quests, and if you have the required amount of the specific statistic 
    for the adventure you are on, you will pass the quest and lose that amount of the statistic. A passed quest may not be       revisited. Passing a quest increases your experience points, and after a certain amount you level up
Rest: This is where your character chooses to rest to regain power and gain a random of 1-3 of each statistic, the idea is       if you failed a previous quest, you may regain strength through resting to be able to beat it later. After resting,         you may revisit previously failed quests.
Quit: Your character decides to leave the game, they will be removed and game proceeds with whoever is left, if no one,           game ends
Save: this is where you can choose to save the game of each character in a .csv file at anytime. 

HOW to play game:
Respond to the prompts as directed in the game, if there is a typo the game will terminate (would take a long time to incorporate raising errors just to keep the game running, so beware not to make any typos). 
Choose the number of characters
Name each character
decide one of 4 options by typing them for each character 'explore' 'rest' 'quit' 'save'
repeat...
